## Quick approval steps
1. Review the [Order Delivery Checklist](order-delivery-checklist.md) to ensure every box remains checked after your final smoke test.
2. Cross-reference the [Delivery Readiness Summary](delivery-readiness.md) for a concise feature recap and verification pointers.
3. Capture or link staging evidence (badges behind usernames, CTA buttons in place, results highlighting) and include it in the delivery note.
4. Note the runtime and version (8.0.23) in the handoff message so hosting teams deploy with the correct stack.

When these items are confirmed, you can proceed with the order delivery.
