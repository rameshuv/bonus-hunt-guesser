### Quick Dev Hints (optional to keep in your Codex)

- Active tournaments filter: ensure query like `post_status=publish` + meta `active=1`.
- This-year hunts: filter by date (year equals current) or stored `year` meta.
- Carousel: prefer a no-jQuery, accessible slider; expose a fallback grid.
- Points engine: centralize in a service; unit test rank → points mapping & totals.
- PHPCS: whitelist specific lines only when necessary; prefer refactors.
- Mail: use filters `bhg_mail_headers`, `bhg_mail_subject`, `bhg_mail_message` for extensibility.
