**Outstanding work before delivery**
1. Update the plugin header to report `Requires at least: 6.3.0` per the contract.
2. Resolve PHPCS violations and harden remaining input handling flagged by the coding-standard report.
3. Surface tournament prizes and affiliate URL visibility on the frontend detail view, honouring the “Show affiliate URL” toggle.
4. Add winner/top-three highlighting to tournament standings so rankings meet the visual specification.
5. Review caching opportunities for heavy dashboard/leaderboard queries to satisfy the performance checklist.
6. Optionally purge orphaned user affiliate assignments when an affiliate website is deleted.
