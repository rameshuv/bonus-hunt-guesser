# 8.0.14 — 2025-09-30
- Align plugin header and constants with v8.0.14 requirements (WordPress 6.3+, MySQL 5.5.5).
- Added prize column and neutral winner highlighting to hunt results and refreshed dashboard winners layout.
- Updated tournaments admin to drop legacy type usage, capture affiliate URLs, and focus hunt selectors on current-year data.
- Updated `[bhg_tournaments]` and leaderboard shortcodes to derive filters from tournament dates instead of the removed `type` column.
- Refined currency handling and prize assets (new image sizes, spec-compliant categories, improved formatting helpers).

## [Stage-1] Hygiene & Safety — 2025-09-03

- Standardized sanitization of `$_GET` / query args for leaderboard: `orderby`, `order`, `paged`, `hunt_id`.
- Added server-side pagination links to `[bhg_leaderboard]` when total > per_page (uses `paginate_links()`).
- Minor hardening in `[bhg_guess_form]` guest redirect URL construction (sanitizes host/URI).
- Note: For MySQL 5.5.5 in strict mode, `DATETIME` defaults of `0000-00-00 00:00:00` may require disabling NO_ZERO_DATE / NO_ZERO_IN_DATE or adjusting defaults.
