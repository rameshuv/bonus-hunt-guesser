## [Stage-1] Hygiene & Safety — 2025-09-03

- Standardized sanitization of `$_GET` / query args for leaderboard: `orderby`, `order`, `paged`, `hunt_id`.
- Added server-side pagination links to `[bhg_leaderboard]` when total > per_page (uses `paginate_links()`).
- Minor hardening in `[bhg_guess_form]` guest redirect URL construction (sanitizes host/URI).
- Note: For MySQL 5.5.5 in strict mode, `DATETIME` defaults of `0000-00-00 00:00:00` may require disabling NO_ZERO_DATE / NO_ZERO_IN_DATE or adjusting defaults.

# Changelog

## 8.0.14 — 2025-10-27
- Added `[my_bonushunts]`, `[my_tournaments]`, `[my_prizes]`, and `[my_rankings]` shortcodes that honour the new My Profile visibility toggles and reuse the global typography settings.
- Implemented the configurable tournament points system with ranking scope controls and ensured recalculations persist both points and wins for admin/front-end displays.
- Synced affiliate website CRUD with user profile metadata so new sites immediately expose checkboxes and deletions clean up user assignments.
- Extended the settings screen with global typography/color controls and wired inline CSS so front-end blocks reflect the configured styles.
- Protected uninstall by respecting the “remove data on uninstall” option and refreshed release notes to match the 8.0.14 requirements.

- Version bump.

## 8.0.10 — 2025-09-12

## 8.0.06 — 2025-09-05

## 8.0.05 — 2025-09-03
- Fix: Affiliate Websites edit query querying wrong table (now selects by `id`).

- Feature: New `[bhg_best_guessers]` shortcode with tabs (Overall, Monthly, Yearly, All-Time).
- UX: Ensure leaderboard affiliate indicators (green/red) always render via CSS.
