# Changelog

## 8.0.05 — 2025-09-03
- Fix: Affiliate Websites edit query querying wrong table (now selects by `id`).
- Security: Server-side enforcement — guesses can only be added/edited while a hunt is `open`.
- Feature: New `[bhg_best_guessers]` shortcode with tabs (Overall, Monthly, Yearly, All-Time).
- UX: Ensure leaderboard affiliate indicators (green/red) always render via CSS.
- Admin: Minor coding-standards cleanups and nonces/cap checks verified.
